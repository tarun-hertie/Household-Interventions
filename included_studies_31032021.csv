This paper will evaluate the energy-saving potential of improving consumer behavior on the basis of a field study. In the original survey plan, the monthly electricity use of households in three typical residential buildings In the city of Hangzhou, China, were monitored from April 2007 to July 2008. A total of 124 households in those buildings were selected as the subject households. Half of them were informed of 34 energy-saving measures before July 2008 to teach them how to improve their behavior and control electric appliances in their daily lives. Finally, a questionnaire survey was administered in the beginning of August 2008 to identify the changes in the occupants' behavior. Based on the comparison analyses among the differences in the electricity uses of the 71 remaining valid samples, the conclusions can be drawn that: (1) residential electricity use will increase continually in the near future in China due to improved standards of living and a greater dependency on electric appliances, and (2) more than 10% of household electricity use can be conserved by Informing occupants of energy-saving measures to improve their behavior.",0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,8,0,['Home visit'],0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,['None'],4,6097,1,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-999,-999,0,NA,Pre-test/post test,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Household energy consumption during the experiment,72.12,-1,", Hangzhou, China",City,NA,NA,-999,36.51089092,1,t-test,Difference of means,Pre-test/post-test,NA,1,45,NA,NA,45,Actual,499,0,single,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,, Hangzhou,China,0.702699886,1.975301018,NA,1.975301018,0.872614163,0.06612119,0.023809524,1.182876825,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,MeansDifferences,PrePost,0,6097,8,No,Yes,After,2009,0,

A random sample of 236 Japanese households participated in the field experiment and the participants were offered two interventions, such as monetary rewards, depending on their reduction in electricity consumption and comparative feedback. The average saving rates of the (i) reward-intervention group (5.9%) and the (ii) reward with comparative feedback group (8.2%) are statistically larger than those of the (iii) control group (1.7%). Our study demonstrates the following. First, our econometric analysis confirmed a significant response by households to financial incentives but a more inconclusive response to the treatment that provided non-financial, additional information. Second, we found a positive influence of treatment externalities across time and households on energy saving. Third, there is a heterogeneous treatment effect in the reward-intervention group, with the households having a high New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) score being more likely to respond to the reward programme and save electricity than those that do not. Finally, and most interestingly, differences in responses to the questionnaire before and after the experiment suggest that the participants had underestimated the marginal costs of saving electricity before they actually started to do so.

khat,stkim@cju.ac.kr,"Kim, ST; Lim, BI; Park, WK; Kim, MK; Son, SY",150432,2016,An analysis on the effectiveness of a smart grid test-bed project: The Korean case,"This study analyzes the effectiveness of Korea's Smart Grid project using Difference-in-Difference (DID) estimation, which utilizes both 2013 survey data on the participating households of the Jeju Smart Grid Test-bed, and the actual electricity use of households during 2009-2012. The findings are as follows. First, the Smart Grid project effectively causes a reduction in electricity use. Second, households which have the following characteristics tend to use more electricity: male householder, many family members, income. Third, households which have better understanding about the Smart Grid use less electricity. Based on these findings, we can derive the following policy implications. First, it is necessary to set up a policy which accelerates active participation of both consumers and producers of related equipment in order to promote the Smart Grid.

In a randomised control trial, we formulate different treatments such as feedback information and norms, as well as prize competition among subjects. We show that information and norms lead to a sharp - more than 20% - reduction in overall energy consumption. Because participants do not pay for their energy consumption this response cannot be driven by cost saving incentives.

In a randomised control trial, we formulate different treatments such as feedback information and norms, as well as prize competition among subjects. We show that information and norms lead to a sharp - more than 20% - reduction in overall energy consumption. Because participants do not pay for their energy consumption this response cannot be driven by cost saving incentives. Interestingly, when combining feedback and norms with a prize competition for achieving low energy consumption, the reduction effect - while present initially - disappears in the long run.

Based on the investigation results, the authors also discuss the policy implications of demand management to shift consumption to days that have more solar radiation, while at the same time reducing overall consumption. The dynamic pricing experiment was implemented on Nushima Island, located in the center of Japan, with the participation of 50 households. The methodologies used in this study are panel analysis with random effects, and the difference in differences method. Several linear regression analyses are performed to predict hourly electricity usage from a number of explanatory variables, such as life-style factors, the frequency of access to the visualization website, control for weather factors (wind speed and temperatures), and other attributes of the households to predict the log of hourly electric energy consumption.

One community was Alice Springs, a town with about 9000 households in the geographic centre of Australia. The programme offered a package of support: free energy audits, discounts for the purchase of renewable energy technology and energy efficiency measures, and ongoing information. Households that adopted solar hot water and photovoltaic systems reduced their electricity usage immediately after adoption by 10% and 34% respectively, and this was maintained in the long term. A small rebound effect of 15% was observed in the photovoltaic adopters. It was observed that, on average, households that adopted only energy efficiency measures did not have a significant reduction in their electricity usage over the long term. However, consistent with expectations, this study did show that there was a significant correlation between the number of energy efficiency measures adopted and the greatest household reduction in electricity usage. These contrary results indicate that there are additional factors involved. The connection between the effective use of measures, coincident behavioural change or increased energy awareness and greater energy reduction is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

About half of these households received feedback together with information about electricity-saving measures (pilot group), while the remaining households served as a control group. Participation in the pilot group was random, but households were able to choose between two types of feedback: access to a web portal or written feedback by post. Results from cross section OLS regression suggest that feedback provided to the pilot group corresponds with electricity savings of around 4.5% for the average household. Our results from quantile regressions imply that for households in the 30th to the 70th percentile of electricity consumption, feedback on electricity consumption is statistically significant and effects are highest in absolute terms and as a share of electricity consumption. For percentiles below or above this range, feedback appears to have no effect. Finally, controlling for a potential endogeneity bias induced by non random participation in the feedback type groups, we find no difference in the effects of feedback provided via the web portal and by post.

Results of a field study in Southern France,"The abundant literature on consumer feedback shows that it is an efficient instrument for reducing household energy consumption. However, the reported reductions are strongly dependent on contextual factors and on the type of feedback provided. Given the importance of learning to this respect, this dimension constitutes the core focus of the present study which reports the findings of the TICELEC (i.e. French acronym for information technologies for responsible electricity consumption) project in France. The experiment included a control group (G1: the self-monitoring group) and one equipped group (G2). All participants reduced their consumption and learnt either directly from feedback or indirectly through self-monitoring. The amount of energy savings, which is larger than in similar experiments, can be explained by two factors. First, the specificity of our sample (i.e. high income, high consumption) which allows for potentially large energy savings. Second, high involvement of participants and the building of trust. The quantitative and qualitative dimensions of learning are then discussed. Additionally, we focus on peak-load shifting in G2 with 2 subgroups (G21 and G22). The higher proportion of shifters in G22 and the higher 'quality' of their shifting suggest a higher level of learning enabled by the more sophisticated feedback. Although this translated into only a moderately higher rate of energy savings, the higher degree of absorbed knowledge (i.e. through 'learning by looking through connecting') might lead to a qualitatively distinctive type of energy saving.",0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,52,0,84,0,['Web portal'],0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['On demand'],32,21000,1,household level,NA,NA,NA,"It's a field study, not an experiment; Actually, it can be coded.

Gamification has recently been used to break habits and induce enduring behavior change. Building upon this work, we designed a new game-based sustainability intervention and tested its effectiveness in two large-scale field studies (total N = 1975). In Study 1, playing our new sustainability game significantly reduced people's household electricity consumption six months after the game. In Study 2, playing the game led to increased self reports of household efforts to save energy and perceived importance of sustainability. In both studies, high-energy consumers changed their environmental behaviors and attitudes the most. The research demonstrates that it is possible to induce a long-term change of habits in the sustainability domain. It also shows that neither attitude change nor conscious implementation intentions are necessary for behavior change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing upon insights from behavioural economics, we propose that consumers underestimate potential gains and overestimate potential financial losses resulting from electricity use. To test the hypothesis, we carried out a pilot study involving the installation of SM technology in Copenhagen, Denmark. The analysis used two baselines, and the differential effects revealed that the provision of loss-framed, salient information reduced daily demand by 7-11%, compared to unframed information. Reductions in standby consumption were more pronounced, with a differential effect of 16-25%.

While most of these programs are deemed to be cost effective, and therefore in the public interest, opportunities exist to improve cost effectiveness by targeting programs to those customers with the greatest potential for energy savings. This article details an analysis of three DSM programs offered by three Florida municipal electric utilities to explore such opportunities. First, we estimate programs' energy savings impacts; second, we measure and compare energy savings across subgroups of program participants as determined by their pre-intervention energy performance, and third, we explore potential changes in program impacts that might be realized by targeting specific customers for participation in the DSM programs. All three programs resulted in statistically significant average (per-participant) energy savings, yet average savings varied widely, with the customers who performed best (i.e., most efficient) before the intervention saving the least energy and those who performed worst (i.e., least efficient) before the intervention saving the most. Assessment of alternative program participation scenarios with varying levels of customer targeting suggests that program impacts could be increased by as much as 80% for a professional energy audit program, just over 100% for a high-efficiency heat pump upgrade program, and nearly 250% for an attic insulation upgrade program.

Unfortunately, research indicates that almost 41% of this power is wasted. Changing the way that consumers use energy may be important in reducing home energy consumption. This paper looks at whether the implementation of certain real-time energy monitors has an impact on the residential rate of energy consumption in a metropolitan area with relatively low electricity rates. In the following case study, 151 Omaha residences were equipped with two variants of the Aztech In-Home Display (Aztech) as well as the Blue Line Power Cost Monitor (PCM) real-time energy monitors for a period of 16 months. The results of the data, 30 days after installation, revealed a statistically insignificant reduction of 12% in mean electrical consumption in houses equipped with a PCM and no reduction in mean consumption in homes using either variants of the Aztech device when compared to a randomly selected control sample. However, they proved effective in the short term if utilized by utilities for mass distribution to foster awareness among participating residents of their own patterns of residential electricity consumption and on the environmental impacts of energy saving.",0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,['In-home display'],0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['On demand'],4,NA,1,no,NA,NA,NA,Data on standard errors not available.

The our goal was to see how much additional electricity savings could be induced using feedback beyond average savings achieved by goal-setting and to provide students information on how to conserve. Design/methodology/approach - All participants set goals related to personal environmental behavior and received electricity-saving tips. Half of the participants were exposed to real-time, group-level, ambient and direct feedback of electric use for their dormitory floor through an iPad display. The control group received no feedback. Findings - The group that received the real-time feedback reduced its consumption, whereas the control group did not. The feedback group's change in consumption was significantly greater than the control group's. The results are discussed in the context of injunctive norms, reminders, ambient feedback and numerical feedback, as well as the theory of planned behavior. Research limitations/implications - Further research could test for long-term effects, whether the interventions applied in this study would be effective in other university contexts and whether the interventions would influence other environmental habits apart from electricity consumption on campuses.

The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their selfreported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

khat,jacarrol@tcd.ie,"Carroll, J; Lyons, S; Denny, E",808730,2014,Reducing household electricity demand through smart metering: The role of improved information about energy saving,"The international roll out of residential smart meters has increased considerably in recent years. The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their selfreported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

The information treatments included: Baseline information (no real-time data), real-time Home information (whole-house data), and real-time Appliance information (data for the whole house plus three individual appliances). Compared to the Baseline group, real-time Home information lowered overall energy use by about 4 %. Real-time information at both the Home and Appliance levels had a significant effect on non-event peak loads: compared to the Baseline group, real-time Home data lowered peak load by 5 %, while Appliance data lowered peak load by 7 %. All three information treatments averaged a 1-kW (40 %) load shed during events. The customer-chosen program options included a dynamic time-of-use rate and a load control incentive program. Customers were more likely to sign up for the dynamic rate, and those who did saved significantly more peak load on both event days (> 50 % savings) and non-event days (> 20 % savings) than did those on the load control program alone.

This paper evaluates the first program to expose residential consumers to hourly real-time pricing (RIP). I find that enrolled households are statistically significantly price elastic and that consumers responded by conserving energy during peak hours, but remarkably did not increase average consumption during off-peak times. The program increased consumer surplus by $10 per household per year. While this is only one to two percent of electricity costs, it illustrates a potential additional benefit from investment in retail Smart Grid applications, including the advanced electricity meters required to observe a household's hourly consumption.

After 5 months, households exposed to the combination of interventions saved 5.1%, while households in the control group used 0.7% more energy. Households exposed to the interventions saved significantly more direct energy than households in the control group did. No difference in indirect energy savings emerged.

Conclusions about the performance of eco-feedback systems in the literature were mostly drawn based on their short-term performance, during which eco-feedback information was continuously provided. This study, by gradually removing eco-feedback system functions in different phases of an experiment, examines the durability of the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback under different conditions. The eco-feedback information is delivered using mobile app, which provides a higher level of accessibility than other eco-feedback technologies. A prototype app-based eco-feedback system was developed in this study, and used in an experiment that was carried out in student dormitories. The experiment lasted for fifty-three weeks, and it included four phases, during which the level of functionality of the eco-feedback system varied. The experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of using mobile app for delivering eco-feedback information. Longitudinal analysis of the results found that the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback changed over time. The effect was significantly positive in the short term, then became slightly positive in the medium term, and further faded to an insignificant level in the long term. Moreover, analysis of individual participants' energy consumption profiles revealed that their behavior changes were highly sensitive and responsive to whether and how eco-feedback information was delivered. This study advances the knowledge about app-based eco-feedback and its effect in reshaping the energy consumption behaviors of occupants in dormitory buildings over time. Future research can be done to further validate the generalizability of the findings to other types of residential buildings or eco-feedback systems using different technologies, so as to provide important implication and guidance for implementing eco-feedback in practice.

Participants (with the exception of the control group) received feedback in various forms, i.e. consumption compared to previous consumption or to similar others; energy saving tips in leaflets or on a computer; or feedback relating to financial or environmental costs. Respondents were interviewed after the start of the study to establish their income, socio-demographic status, environmental attitudes and the extent to which they already engaged in conserving activities. Participants also took part in focus groups after the final meter readings were taken. Overall the results indicated that income and demographic features predicted historic energy consumption but not changes in consumption during the field study, where environmental attitudes and feedback were influential. Of all the feedback groups, the installation of computers helped reduce consumption most markedly. Furthermore, people with positive environmental attitudes, but who had not previously been engaged in many conservation actions, were more likely to change their consumption subsequent to the feedback period. Recommendations are made both for energy conservation policy and future research.

khat,jason.harold@esri.ie,"Harold, J; Lyons, S; Cullinan, J",881513,2018,Heterogeneity and persistence in the effect of demand side management stimuli on residential gas consumption,"Feedback on residential energy consumption has long been identified as an effective demand side management (DSM) instrument to encourage household energy conservation. This paper explores the heterogeneous treatment effects of a DSM program on residential gas consumption across different groups of households categorised by their socio-economic and household characteristics. The program was employed in Ireland's Smart Metering Gas Consumer Behavioural Trial and the demand stimuli tested consisted of informational feedback on a household's gas usage. The paper also investigates the impact of the stimuli over time and across the distribution of daily household gas consumption. The demand stimuli are found to have very different effects across the socio-economic and dwelling characteristics of the households with older and larger households and dwellings revealed to be much more responsive to the feedback. Additionally, the results provide evidence that the impacts are persistent over time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

khat,NA,"Matsukawa, I.",882720,2018,Information acquisition and residential electricity consumption: Evidence from a field experiment,"This article uses hourly data on household usage of an in-home display (IHD) in a randomized field experiment to investigate how acquiring information from IHDs affects electricity usage of households. Providing IHDs, which enables households to see a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time, is a promising policy intervention that corrects for biases associated with inattention and limited information-processing capacity by promoting salience and learning. The immediate effect of providing an IHD is heightened household attention to information on consumption, and the repetition of attention is expected to improve households’ capacity to process information. The estimation results of a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity of 501 households living in a southern area of Kyoto, Japan, over 36 days in summer 2012 provide evidence on the effects of real-time information feedback over time. The cumulative usage of IHDs reduced hourly electricity consumption of “energy-using” households whose electricity consumption before the experiment had been far higher than other households. Contrary to the energy-conservation literature, the cumulative usage of IHDs raised electricity consumption of “energy-saving” households whose electricity consumption had been relatively modest before the experiment. This may be due to a “boomerang effect,” which raised electricity usage of well-informed households whose electricity saving had exceeded the optimal saving before obtaining information about their actual usage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,['not relevant'],0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,On demand,5,4383,1,Household level,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.2394,0.0091,Clustered at household,NA,126,NA,actual control,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Log hourly electricity consumption,NA,-1,"Kyotanabe City, Kizugawa City, and Seika Town, Kyoto, Japan",city,432864,NA,10,NA,3,t-test,Household Fixed effects regression,Control-treatment,26.307,2,501,NA,NA,375,actual,165,0,single,duplicates,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Kyotanabe City, Kizugawa City, and Seika Town", Kyoto,Japan,0.761623789,NA,NA,NA,1.000070564,NA,0.002008032,23.94,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Asia,PanelEffects,Control-treatment,1,4383,5,Yes,Yes,After,2018,0,

The article aims to identify the effectiveness and potential of smart meters and real-time IHDs in reducing Shanghai household energy consumption by affecting occupants’ behaviour. A general landscape of the occupant behaviour in residential buildings was briefly painted. A pilot study in Shanghai with an effective sample of 131 respondents was arranged into two groups as IHD and non-IHD households. A dedicated statistical analysis model was developed based on the micro-level empirical data to investigate the characteristics and the regulations of electricity consumption in these two groups, such as check frequency, electricity consumption reduction and shifting, energy bill saving, and standby power. The research results demonstrate that IHDs could lead to around 9.1% reduction in monthly electricity consumption and about 11.0% cut off in monthly electricity bills. A general comparison of the electricity consumption reduction between this research and the average UK case was further made. Barriers at current stage and challenges for further work were finally discussed. The statistical model is expected to ‘future proof’ smart meter and real-time displays through macro-level designing in modularity and flexibility in China. The overall research initially proves the concept of the feasible impact of smart meter and display technologies in the Chinese context, which is further expected to contribute to the empirical evidence on how IHD feedback could influence household electricity consumption in the Chinese context. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,NA,1,NA,NA,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,0,NA,NA,['In-home display'],0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,On demand,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Everyone is under some sort of TOU tariff.; randomisation issue--,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-888,100.1,76,53.8,actual control,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Household energy consumption,9.1,-1,China,City,NA,NA,14,47.39,1,t-test,Difference of means,Control-treatment,NA,1,131,91,36.7,55,actual,58,0,multi,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,China,0.095572322,0.192023634,NA,0.192023634,0.095864915,0.03148045,0.0078125,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,MeansDifferences,Control-treatment,1,NA,NA,Yes,No,After,2019,0,

In this paper, I evaluate how low-income households in a major Colombian city respond to this policy. Using hourly household electricity consumption data, I find that, on average, households reduce electricity consumption by 4.5% as a result of the policy. It is striking that even low-income households, who consume relatively small amounts of electricity, respond to energy-saving policies and engage in conservation behaviors in the short term. In my analysis, I also find that the effect is stronger the higher the household pre-treatment electricity consumption levels and smaller among poorer households. However, the heterogeneity in terms of income level vanishes once I control for household pre-program electricity consumption levels.

Afield experiment of dynamic pricing was carried out on Nushima Island, which is located in Hyogo Prefecture in central Japan. The panel data of hourly electric power consumption among 50 households (including 22 control households and 28 treated households) were collected from a baseline survey (14 days before the dynamic pricing experiment was conducted) and during the 14-day experimental period. Propensity score analysis with local linear matching was employed to analyze the average treatment effects of dynamic pricing on consumer behavior. The results report that dynamic pricing plays a crucial role in reducing consumers' electric power consumption-by 9.6% compared to the pre-experimental period. © 2018 Energies.

Socio-demographic attributes of individual households were recorded and building thermal performance was evaluated by detailed computer simulation. Attitudes of the study participants to environmental issues were assessed to identify potential motivations for energy savings. Although yearon-year energy consumption increased for exogenous reasons in all test groups, in Jerusalem the increase in the maximum intervention group (which received detailed information on energy consumption patterns over time, and individually tailored energy-saving tips) was 2.5%, compared to 9.5% in the reference group, which received only generic energy saving tips. The difference among groups in Nesher was not significant. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the attempt to influence apartment occupants' behaviour failed to generate a statistically significant reduction in domestic energy consumption. The study underlines the importance of controlling for endogenous factors, such as weather and building thermal performance, while evaluating the effectiveness of different intervention strategies, to avoid potentially wrong inferences about the effectiveness of such strategies.

As a consequence of the Energy Fitness Program's unique approach, it has become one of the nation's most successful home energy audit programs. This article provides a brief summary of the unique elements of the Santa Monica Program's approach, describes the components of the experimental design by which the effort was completed, and presents the final results of the evaluation performed to measure the program's effectiveness.

khat,NA,"Fijnheer, J.D.L.; van Oostendorp, H.; Veltkamp, R.C.",1771477,2019,Enhancing energy conservation by a household energy game,"This paper presents the results of a study, comparing a game versus a dashboard with respect to energy conservation in the household. In a pretest-posttest design, an empirical study tested whether change in attitude, knowledge, engagement and behaviour with respect to energy conservation in the household was different for participants playing Powersaver Game compared to a control condition where participants used an energy dashboard with the same content, but excluding game features. The aim of this game (developed using an iterative user-centered game design methodology) is to influence household energy consumption by means of electricity and gas usage in the long-term. The intervention time was at least 5 weeks and pre and post measures based on 21 days intervals. All energy conservation activities that the application provides (e.g. washing clothes on low temperatures) take place in the real world and feedback is based on real time energy consumption. This inverse gamification principle aims to optimize the transfer between the game world and the real world. Energy consumption significantly changed in the game condition compared to the control condition, and the difference between both conditions is more than 33% after the intervention. In the game condition, knowledge about energy conservation was significantly increased, although no significant differences in increase of attitude and engagement were found. We conclude that Powersaver Game is effective in transfer of energy conservation knowledge, which leads to energy saving behaviour on the long term. It cannot be concluded that playing the game leads to a greater change in attitude, however, attitude scores of the participants were high from the start. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0,1,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,['-888'],0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,3,NA,1,Household level randomization,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-999,-12.2,5,18.5,actual control,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Percent reduction in energy consumption,33.6,-1,Netherlands,-999,NA,NA,263,13.60330842,1,t-test,Difference of means,Difference in Difference,NA,1,11,21.4,7.7,6,-999,134,0,single,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,Netherlands,0.777170018,2.469987371,NA,2.469987371,1.038184217,0.643977467,0.125,33.6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Europe excl.

s.laukemper@mpp.hertie-school.org,NA,"Young, Robert M",1901265,2014,Variations on the normative feedback model for energy efficient behavior in the context of military family housing.,"In discussions on energy efficiency, the topic often involves the development of a new technology. But models that target human behavior change can also generate significant energy savings, often with less expense. One such model that has been employed to millions of households across the United States is the normative feedback model. This model integrates the most salient research from the field of social norms into the utility billing process. Residents receive a home energy report that compares their energy consumption to the average energy consumption of their neighbors. Resulting behavior changes have led to energy savings of between 1.4% and 3.1% (Alcott, 2011). This research tests three variations of the normative feedback model, with the aim of determining its boundary conditions and improving it. Each variation aligns with one of the three research objectives: 1) to determine whether normative feedback generates significant energy savings when applied to households that are not billed for utility usage, 2) to determine whether increasing the proximity of comparison increases the energy savings generated by normative feedback, and 3) to determine energy savings associated with the implementation of a normative-based utility billing system. The first two variations were tested through an experiment conducted at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where residents are not currently billed for their utility usage. Residents received normative feedback via home energy reports for three consecutive months. Results were analyzed through both a differences-in-differences analysis and a multiple regression analysis, and an overall energy savings of 3.8% was identified. Thus, the normative feedback model can generate energy savings even in the absence of a billing system and could therefore be employed in the two-thirds of military family housing that are not yet billed for utilities, with resulting savings of approximately $19.3 million annually. In the home energy report experiment, residents were compared at three different levels of proximity: neighborhood, street, and next-door neighbor. The analysis identified an energy savings of 3.8% at the neighborhood level, 4.9% at the street level, and 2.8% at the next-door neighbor level. These results indicate a ""sweet spot"" in setting the proximity level of comparisons. By increasing the proximity from the neighborhood to the street level, energy savings increased, which is consistent with expectations based on a previous study in a different context (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). But increasing the proximity further to the next-door neighbor level actually reduced the energy savings. Therefore, to maximize effectiveness, future applications of normative feedback for energy efficiency should make comparisons at the street level of proximity. And finally, this research investigated the use of normative feedback as the basis for a utility billing system. Such a system, as implemented at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, establishes a monthly baseline equal to the average energy consumption for that month. Residents make payments for their consumption over the baseline and receive payments for their consumption under the baseline. A multiple regression analysis found that the implementation of this billing system into a community not previously billed for utility usage generated an energy savings of 14.1%. This result takes an important first step towards the development of a billing program optimization model for the military's transition to utility billing.

Results were analyzed through both a differences-in-differences analysis and a multiple regression analysis, and an overall energy savings of 3.8% was identified. Thus, the normative feedback model can generate energy savings even in the absence of a billing system and could therefore be employed in the two-thirds of military family housing that are not yet billed for utilities, with resulting savings of approximately $19.3 million annually. In the home energy report experiment, residents were compared at three different levels of proximity: neighborhood, street, and next-door neighbor. The analysis identified an energy savings of 3.8% at the neighborhood level, 4.9% at the street level, and 2.8% at the next-door neighbor level. These results indicate a ""sweet spot"" in setting the proximity level of comparisons. By increasing the proximity from the neighborhood to the street level, energy savings increased, which is consistent with expectations based on a previous study in a different context (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). But increasing the proximity further to the next-door neighbor level actually reduced the energy savings. Therefore, to maximize effectiveness, future applications of normative feedback for energy efficiency should make comparisons at the street level of proximity. And finally, this research investigated the use of normative feedback as the basis for a utility billing system. Such a system, as implemented at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, establishes a monthly baseline equal to the average energy consumption for that month. Residents make payments for their consumption over the baseline and receive payments for their consumption under the baseline. A multiple regression analysis found that the implementation of this billing system into a community not previously billed for utility usage generated an energy savings of 14.1%. This result takes an important first step towards the development of a billing program optimization model for the military's transition to utility billing.

But models that target human behavior change can also generate significant energy savings, often with less expense. One such model that has been employed to millions of households across the United States is the normative feedback model. This model integrates the most salient research from the field of social norms into the utility billing process. Residents receive a home energy report that compares their energy consumption to the average energy consumption of their neighbors. Resulting behavior changes have led to energy savings of between 1.4% and 3.1% (Alcott, 2011). This research tests three variations of the normative feedback model, with the aim of determining its boundary conditions and improving it. Each variation aligns with one of the three research objectives: 1) to determine whether normative feedback generates significant energy savings when applied to households that are not billed for utility usage, 2) to determine whether increasing the proximity of comparison increases the energy savings generated by normative feedback, and 3) to determine energy savings associated with the implementation of a normative-based utility billing system.

Much research in many different fields, including behavioral sciences, economics and sociology, has been carried out to understand and possibly influence domestic energy consumption patterns. In this paper we conduct a field experiment of an online application, jointly developed with Dutch energy utility Greenchoice. During one month, a sample of customers was requested to record and submit the readouts of their electricity meter. These readouts were then converted to easily comprehensible information that was fed back to the customer. Performance was also compared to a control group which did not receive any feedback and served as a baseline. The results suggest that feedback through the web application does indeed increase perceived consumer awareness and reduces electricity consumption.

We conducted an 18-week randomized controlled field trial in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, to explore what kind of feedback measures can encourage urban residents to save electricity when given a challenging power-saving goal. The experiment included 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. The four experimental groups were given the same 15% power-saving goal in the first 14 weeks and received contrast feedback. Different types of feedback content (self-contrast and others-contrast) and different feedback frequencies (once a week and twice a week) were used. After 14 weeks, the contrast feedback stopped, and we observed whether the power-saving behavior was sustainable only in the target situation. We collected household electricity consumption data from the power supply company's metering system, and we performed an analysis of covariance to control the influence of residents' existing electricity consumption habits. The results revealed four key findings. (1) Setting the 15% power-saving goal and providing others-contrast feedback (OCF) effectively promoted urban residents' power savings. The goal and OCF groups saved 14.45% and 11.86%, respectively. (2) Regarding the feedback content, the power-saving effect was significantly stronger in the OCF groups than in the self-contrast feedback (SCF) groups.

The article aims to identify the effectiveness and potential of smart meters and real-time IHDs in reducing Shanghai household energy consumption by affecting occupants' behaviour. A general landscape of the occupant behaviour in residential buildings was briefly painted. A pilot study in Shanghai with an effective sample of 131 respondents was arranged into two groups as IHD and non-IHD households. A dedicated statistical analysis model was developed based on the micro-level empirical data to investigate the characteristics and the regulations of electricity consumption in these two groups, such as check frequency, electricity consumption reduction and shifting, energy bill saving, and standby power. The research results demonstrate that IHDs could lead to around 9.1% reduction in monthly electricity consumption and about 11.0% cut off in monthly electricity bills. A general comparison of the electricity consumption reduction between this research and the average UK case was further made. Barriers at current stage and challenges for further work were finally discussed. The statistical model is expected to 'future proof smart meter and real-time displays through macro-level designing in modularity and flexibility in China.

As we and others argue, part of the problem is that such interventions do not work equally well for everyone. The significance of a feedback intervention for actual energy savings depends on the rigor with which people make use of smart-meter-based information.

Experiments on the Role of Incentives on Energy Conservation (Economics Working
Paper No. 2589269).","There is increasing research on the impact of social norms on economic behavior. The research to date has a number of limitations: 1) it has not de-coupled the impact of the norm and the knowledge required to understand how to change behavior based upon it; and 2) it has not understood the impact of social norms under different incentive structures. We address these limitations using two natural field experiments. We find, firstly, that norms change energy consumption irrespective of whether information is provided or not. We find that social norms reduce consumption by around 6% (0.2 standard deviations). Secondly, we find that large financial rewards for targeted consumption reductions work very well in reducing consumption, with a 8% reduction (0.35 standard deviations) in energy consumption. The effect persists even when the financial incentive has been removed, suggesting no crowding out of financial incentives. Perhaps most interestingly, we find that the large effect of financial incentives completely disappears when information on social norms is included.

information on occupant behavior. The newest type of feedback, “real-time” or continuous
energy use monitoring, has become popular through its application in educational and
professional settings. This paper investigates whether continuous feedback is effective in a
residential setting, and explores the effects of socioeconomic status and household characteristics
on conservation practices and energy use consciousness. Ten households were randomly invited
from a 60-household survey to receive a digital electricity monitor called The Energy Detective.
Drawing on surveys, utility bill records, and semi-structured interviews with these households,
we discuss the effectiveness of the monitor in each household. We conclude that the monitors
have a greater effect on energy consciousness than on conservation behavior in both high-income
and low-income homes. Recommendations are made for a more extensive study involving

Although savings were found not to be statistically significant, an effect size was detected (0.2). Therefore, future steps should exploit all available opportunities to replicate the pilot and increase the sample size so as to gain stronger evidence of the game's impact. Preliminary results support the utility of gaming investment in the household energy efficiency field, and provide useful insights and pathways that could be incorporated into the development of future serious game interventions to foster their effectiveness.

Our data thus suggest important policy complementarities between behavioral and financial incentives: whereas non-pecuniary interventions disproportionately affect intense users, financial incentives are able to substantially affect the low-user, “sticky households.”",0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,NA,0,0,1,0,52,0,164,0,['Mail'],0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,['monthly'],112,NA,1,household level,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.3158,0.0477,robust standard erros clustered at the household level,NA,17768,NA,actual control,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Avg daily electricity consumption (kWh),NA,-1,",Northeast,USA",region,4616989,0.01,36,NA,1,t-test,OLS regression,Difference in Difference,6.620545073,2,195826,NA,NA,178058,actual,592,0,single,,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,",Northeast",United States,0.014959255,NA,NA,NA,0.014960371,NA,5.11E-06,1.3,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,United States,OLS,DID,1,NA,164,Yes,Yes,After,2017,0,
